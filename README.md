# ds_twitter_sentiment
Get a live stream of tweets into a SQLite DB and perform sentiment analysis
The assignment has 2 parts:

1. Save a stream of tweets
2. Perform sentiment analysis
 
This is an example of the output - individual words, tweets and their sentiment scores. <br />
I have not included other data such as username, location, etc. and I eliminated some identifying information from the tweets.
