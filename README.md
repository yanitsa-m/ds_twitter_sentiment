# Perform sentiment analysis on tweets

The assignment has 2 parts:

1. Save a stream of tweets into SQLite database & JSON file
2. Perform sentiment analysis and get sentiment scores
 
This is an example of the output - individual words, tweets and their sentiment scores. <br />
I have not included other data such as username, location, etc. and I eliminated some identifying information from the tweets.
